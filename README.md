# nigerian-car-market-excel-dashboard
A visually-styled dashboard of the Nigerian car market recreated in Microsoft Excel.   This repo contains the dashboard workbook, a small sample of the source data, and screenshots.
## Files
- `dashboard/Nigerian_Car_Market_Dashboard.xlsx` — Excel file (interactive; enable editing to use slicers)
- `data/car45_sample.csv` — sample data used to build visuals
- `images/dashboard_screenshot1.png` — screenshot #1
- `images/dashboard_screenshot2.png` — screenshot #2

## Highlights / Technical notes
- Built fully in Excel: custom KPI cards, icon-based navigation, maps, donut/column/bar visuals.
- Data cleaning and transformation done inside Excel before visualization.
- Map visualization uses a static image / shapefile overlay (see workbook).
- Screenshots included for quick preview — open the workbook to interact.

## How to view
1. Download the `.xlsx` file and open with Microsoft Excel.  
2. If Excel opens in Protected View, click **Enable Editing** to allow interactions.  
3. You may need to enable macros if used (not required for basic visuals).
